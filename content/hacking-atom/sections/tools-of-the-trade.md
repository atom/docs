### Tools of the Trade

To begin, there are a few things we'll assume you know, at least to some degree. Since all of Atom is implemented using web technologies, we have to assume you know web technologies such as JavaScript and CSS. Specifically, we'll be implementing everything in JavaScript(or CoffeeScript) and Less. The latter is simply a preprocessors for CSS.

Less is an even simpler transition from CSS. It adds a number of useful things like variables and functions to CSS. You can learn about Less at [lesscss.org](http://lesscss.org/). Our usage of Less won't get too complex in this book however, so as long as you know basic CSS you should be fine.

**Note:** Ealier versions of Atom and its core packages are implemented in [CoffeeScripts](http://coffeescript.org), which is a preprocessor of JavaScript. Currently most of the codes in Atom have been transcribed back to JavaScript (aka. decaffeinated), which is also the default language of Package Generator in Atom.
